# Off with their heads!

A guillotine for gnome-terminal, the default terminal for gnome.
Remove the header from the terminal window for a cleaner feel.

## How to install

If you're lazy like me you can run this in your terminal.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesintesi/terminal-guillotine/main/guillotine.sh -qO- | bash
```

If you want to check the code and do everything by yourself,
just copy the content of `gtk.css` in this repo and paste it
at the end of `~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css`.
